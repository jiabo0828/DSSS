Road traffic accidents represent a major global issue, accounting for a significant number of annual casualties. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 1.35 million lives are lost annually due to these accidents. Identifying the contributing factors and their influence on casualties is essential for developing targeted and effective road safety measures and policies. This report examines a comprehensive dataset of road traffic accidents, focusing on key determinants such as lighting, weather, and road surface conditions, with the ultimate aim of enhancing road safety for all users.
The dataset encompasses various accident-related parameters, including accident severity, number of vehicles involved, road and weather conditions, as well as driver, vehicle, and casualty characteristics. Using a range of statistical and machine learning techniques, such as linear regression, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, and Random Forests, the study aims to elucidate the relationships between these factors and the number of casualties in road traffic accidents.
Previous studies have produced inconsistent findings on the relationship between weather conditions and accident severity. Potoglou’s research indicates that drivers often adjust their driving behavior during adverse weather, leading to fewer severe accidents. Ma’s study demonstrates the increased likelihood of serious pedestrian and vehicle accidents on poorly lit roads, while Yubian’s research emphasizes the significant impact of road conditions and speed limits on traffic collision severity.
In subsequent sections, the dataset will be detailed, addressing data preprocessing steps, and presenting exploratory data analysis results. The report will then outline the model selection, evaluation, and tuning processes, focusing on the most promising models for casualty prediction. Finally, recommendations for future research and potential applications of the findings in the road safety domain will be discussed.
